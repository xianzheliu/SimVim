# SimVim v0.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------
**A Simply Vim Configuration and Tutorial**

Contain a complete Vim Configuration V0.1 and an cscope autoload 
database plugin.

This Simple Vim configuration consistis of the features uesd
in your daily development and code review, just need to copy vimrc
file and the autoload_cscope.vim.
The configuration file has the following features.
    -autoindent
    -show linenumber
    -change colorscheme
    -autocomplete the parenthesis
    -switch from left to right in a new line
    -visual complete command
    -immediate show the searche result
    -uniform the encoding set
    -the directory tree
    -keep the cursor always in the middle position
    -(Todo)
And one more thing is that used the cscope plugin for the convience
of viewing code. But one tricky thing is that the database can not
be load automaticly. So I use the Vim official plugin to make it
perfect.
